Flying Dove site 2 is a site that was made with bootstrap 4, html, and jqery. This project was to help me better understand these technologies
so that I can better understand their benefits and downsides. This site is also better than my original which is also a plus. 

Some key takeaways I got from this project is adding animations with plain css and with bootstrap the differences and benefits of either. 
I also learned how jqery can add a lot of functionality versus vanilla javascript.
